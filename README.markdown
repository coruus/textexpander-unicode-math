textexpander-unicode-math
=========================

Python script to generate TextExpander snippets for Unicode Math symbols.

(Brett Terpstra has done some similar work for other symbols; there is also
a Latex math snippet set floating around, but it is missing many operators
that I need regularly.)

Relies on [Will Robinson's][wspr] [Unicode Math Table][unimath_table].

Generates single-comma-prefixed TextExpander snippets, intended for
using Unimath symbols on iOS.

(Includes some idiosyncratic abbreviations from my personal LaTeX
macros; you may want to remove these.)
